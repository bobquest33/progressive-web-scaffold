## Coding Guidelines

The following section sets out some guidelines for code being submitted to the
Progressive Web scaffold.  These are not hard-and-fast rules but rather guidelines that
help to make for a consistent and easy-to-learn codebase.

### JavaScript

We write ES6 wherever we can. Our scaffold contains linting to help you follow our
guidelines, [which can be found here](https://github.com/mobify/mobify-code-style/tree/develop/es6)
